## 🏆 Code Quality

This project maintains high code quality standards using **SonarCloud** for continuous analysis:

- **Quality Gate**: ✅ Passing (A-rated on all metrics)
- **Coverage Target**: 90% (gate requirement: 80%)
- **Integration**: Automatic Analysis via GitHub App
- **Philosophy**: "Clean as You Code" - focus on new code quality

All pull requests are automatically scanned for bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and security hotspots.
See [SonarCloud Quality Standards](docs/SONARCLOUD_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md) for detailed metrics and thresholds.

## 📋 About

This repository documents my journey building a production-grade ML platform from scratch. The goal is to gain
hands-on experience with:

- **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform for AWS resources
- **Container Orchestration** - Kubernetes on AWS EKS
- **ML Infrastructure** - Model registry, feature store, experiment tracking
- **CI/CD & GitOps** - Automated testing, deployment pipelines
- **Observability** - Monitoring, logging, alerting
- **Platform Engineering** - Design patterns, best practices, trade-offs

## 🗂️ Project Management

This project uses **GitHub Projects** to track all work, learnings, and progress.

📊 **[View Project Board](https://github.com/users/wlevan3/projects)**

### Project Structure

- **Status Board** - Track work by status (Backlog → In Progress → Done)
- **Component Board** - Organize by platform component (EKS, Model Registry, etc.)
- **Roadmap View** - Timeline visualization of practicum phases
- **Learning Reflections** - Document insights and takeaways

See [Project Management Guide](docs/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md) for detailed setup and workflows.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The ML platform consists of these core components:

- **EKS Cluster** - Kubernetes cluster for running ML workloads
- **Model Registry** - MLflow for model versioning and tracking
- **Feature Store** - Centralized feature management
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated testing and deployment
- **Observability Stack** - Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack

(Architecture diagram coming soon)

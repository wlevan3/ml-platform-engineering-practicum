## üìã About

This repository documents my journey building a production-grade ML platform from scratch. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with:

- **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform for AWS resources
- **Container Orchestration** - Kubernetes on AWS EKS
- **ML Infrastructure** - Model registry, feature store, experiment tracking
- **CI/CD & GitOps** - Automated testing, deployment pipelines
- **Observability** - Monitoring, logging, alerting
- **Platform Engineering** - Design patterns, best practices, trade-offs

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Management

This project uses **GitHub Projects** to track all work, learnings, and progress.

üìä **[View Project Board](https://github.com/users/wlevan3/projects)**

### Project Structure

- **Status Board** - Track work by status (Backlog ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done)
- **Component Board** - Organize by platform component (EKS, Model Registry, etc.)
- **Roadmap View** - Timeline visualization of practicum phases
- **Learning Reflections** - Document insights and takeaways

See [Project Management Guide](docs/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md) for detailed setup and workflows.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The ML platform consists of these core components:

- **EKS Cluster** - Kubernetes cluster for running ML workloads
- **Model Registry** - MLflow for model versioning and tracking
- **Feature Store** - Centralized feature management
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated testing and deployment
- **Observability Stack** - Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack

_(Architecture diagram coming soon)_

## üìñ Development Workflow

This project follows production-grade practices:

1. **Create Issue** - Use GitHub Projects and issue templates
2. **Create Branch** - Feature branches from `main`
3. **Develop** - Follow coding standards
4. **Test** - Run pre-commit hooks and tests
5. **Create PR** - Use PR template, self-review
6. **CI/CD** - Automated checks must pass
7. **Merge** - Squash merge to keep history clean

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

## üìù Learning Reflections

A key part of this practicum is documenting learnings and design decisions. Use the **Learning Reflection** issue template to capture:

- Key insights and takeaways
- Challenges encountered and solutions
- Trade-offs and alternative approaches
- Resources that helped
